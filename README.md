### Hi there 👋, I'm Clara (she/her)!

I'm driven by a passion for inclusive design, renewable technology, and creating beautiful, user-centered experiences that make a positive impact on both people and the planet.<br />
Here's a little about me:

- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Api's with **Bun** and mobile apps with **Ionic**.  
- 🔭 **What I'm Working On**: I'm currently rebuilding [Life Notes](https://github.com/sebferrer/life-notes) to provide a modern, user-friendly way for individuals to track their symptoms and medications, making it easier to manage health and well-being effectively.
- 🖌️ **Hobbies**: Outside of coding, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting and exploring nature.
